## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a hardware-based CRC implementation that can be integrated into digital communication systems, such as networking devices, storage systems, or embedded devices. CRC is a widely used error-detection algorithm that ensures the integrity of transmitted data by appending a checksum to the data stream.

## Project Description
The CRC module is implemented in Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). It utilizes Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to generate the checksum for the input data stream. The LFSR generates a cyclic sequence of bits, which is XORed with the data to produce the CRC checksum. The project aims to achieve a high-speed and resource-efficient design to meet the requirements of real-time data processing.

## Key Features
- Verilog HDL implementation of CRC algorithm using LFSR technique.
- Configurable polynomial selection for CRC calculation.
- Easily adaptable to different data widths and CRC sizes.
- Simulation testbenches to verify the correctness of the CRC implementation.
- Test vectors for functional verification.
- Documentation explaining the design, implementation, and testing process.
